Hi,

It seems you found the hopeless folder.

Countless hours was spent trying to implement the boat with propellers
as a differential drive.

However, even though it worked to move at first, it did not turn.

It was the same problem as the first task. The boat does not want to turn
at all...

Well... Guess we gotta use waterwheels on the side then.
