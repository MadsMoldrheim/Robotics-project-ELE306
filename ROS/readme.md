**Propeller_diffdrive_project**\
Project working on bouyancy, propeller and thrusters. It does not run anymore due to multiple changes, but included due to having usable files and good base for further work.
Based on the http://wiki.ros.org/usv_gazebo_plugins, and the https://github.com/osrf/vrx. 


**Main problem when working with differential drive**\
The reccuring problem with the differential drive was it not wanting to turn. Here is a video showing the differential drive before and after moving the waterwheels forward. Reasons like friction and collision is not the cause of this problem. Music was not intentionally added, but in the end made it more pleasurable to watch.
